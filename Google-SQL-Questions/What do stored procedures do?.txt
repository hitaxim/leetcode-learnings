Stored procedures are a lot like functions in programming. They're used to encapsulate and organize business logic into one unit of code, and they can accept multiple input parameters and return multiple output values.

For example, if you were a Data Analyst at Google working on a HR analytics project, you might create a stored procedure to calculate the average salary for a given department:

CREATE FUNCTION get_avg_salary(department_name TEXT)
RETURNS NUMERIC AS
$BODY$
BEGIN
  RETURN (SELECT AVG(salary) FROM google_employees WHERE department = department_name);
END;
$BODY$
LANGUAGE 'plpgsql';


To call this stored procedure and find the average salary for the Data Analytics department you'd write the following query:

SELECT get_avg_salary('Data Analytics');
