Stored procedures are like functions in Python â€“ they can accept input params and return values, and 
are used to encapsulate complex logic.

Instead of having to write this query over-and-over again, you could write a stored procedure like the following:

CREATE FUNCTION get_conversion_rate(start_date DATE, end_date DATE, event_name TEXT)
RETURNS NUMERIC AS
$BODY$
BEGIN
  RETURN (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM events WHERE event_date BETWEEN start_date AND end_date AND event_name = 'conversion')
          / (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM events WHERE event_date BETWEEN start_date AND end_date AND event_name = 'impression');
END;
$BODY$
LANGUAGE 'plpgsql';
To call this stored procedure, you'd execute the following query:

SELECT get_conversion_rate('2023-01-01', '2023-01-31', 'conversion');
