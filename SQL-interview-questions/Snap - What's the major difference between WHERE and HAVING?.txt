Let's address the GROUP BY clause which is used in a SELECT statement to group rows into a set of summary rows. 
It's typically used in conjunction with aggregate functions such as:

SUM
AVG
MIN
MAX
The HAVING clause is used to filter the groups created by the GROUP BY clause. 
It's similar to the WHERE clause, but it is used to specify conditions on the groups created by the GROUP BY clause, 
rather than on the individual rows of the table.

For example:

SELECT department, SUM(salary)
FROM snap_employees
GROUP BY department
HAVING SUM(salary) > 1000000;

This query retrieves the total salary for each department and groups the rows by department. 
The HAVING clause then filters the groups to include only Snap departments where the total salary is greater than $1 million

Note that the HAVING clause must be used after the GROUP BY clause and can only reference columns listed in the GROUP BY clause 
or aggregated columns selected by the SELECT statement.
