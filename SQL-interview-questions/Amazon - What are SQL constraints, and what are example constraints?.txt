Constraints are simply rules for what data goes into your database. Some SQL constraints are:

NOT NULL - Stops NULL value from being inserted
UNIQUE - Ensures unique values are inserted
INDEX - Speeds up querying based on optimizing for a specific column that's often used to lookup records.
PRIMARY KEY - Uniquely identifies each record
FOREIGN KEY - Ensures referential integrity from on record to another in a different table
