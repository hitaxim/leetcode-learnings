The primary key of a table is a column or set of columns that serves as a unique identifier for each row. 
It ensures that all rows are distinct and does not allow null values.

The primary key is also an important part of the table because it enables you to easily identify and reference specific campaigns 
in your Snap Ad data. You can use it to join to other tables in the database, 
such as a table with data on the results of the campaigns.
