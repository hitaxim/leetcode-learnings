Constraints are just rules for your DBMS to follow when updating/inserting/deleting data.

NOT NULL: This constraint could be used to ensure that certain columns in the employee table, such as the employee's first and last name, 
cannot contain NULL values.

UNIQUE: This constraint could be used to ensure that the employee ID is unique. 
This would prevent duplicate entries in the employee table.

PRIMARY KEY: This constraint could be used to combine the NOT NULL and UNIQUE constraints to create a primary key for the employee table. 
The employee ID could serve as the primary key.

FOREIGN KEY: This constraint could be used to establish relationships between the employee table and other tables in the database. 
For example, you could use a foreign key to link the employee ID to the department ID in a department table to track which department each employee belongs to.

CHECK: This constraint could be used to ensure that certain data meets specific conditions. 
For example, you could use a CHECK constraint to ensure that salary values are always positive numbers.

DEFAULT: This constraint could be used to specify default values for certain columns. 
For example, you could use a DEFAULT constraint to set the employee hire date to the current date if no value is provided when a new employee is added to the database.
