BETWEEN is used to select rows that match a range of values, whereas the IN operator checks for values in a specified list of values.

For example, say you were a Data Analyst at Pinterest and had a table of advertising campaign data.

To find campaigns with between 
500
a
n
d
500and10k in spend, you could use BETWEEN`:

SELECT * 
FROM  pinterest_ad_campaigns
WHERE spend BETWEEN 500 AND 10000;
To find ad campaigns that were run on Facebook and Google's Display Network, you could use IN:

SELECT * 
FROM pinterest_ad_campaigns
WHERE ad_platform IN ("fb", "google_display");
