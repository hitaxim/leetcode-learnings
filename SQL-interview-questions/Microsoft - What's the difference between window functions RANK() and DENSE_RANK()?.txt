As the name implies, the RANK() window function ranks each row within your window/partition. 
If two rows have the same rank, the next number in the ranking will be the previous rank plus the number of duplicates. 
For example, if you've got three records tied for 5th place, they'll get the values 5, 6, and 7, and the next row 
after this 3-way tie will have a rank of 8.

The DENSE_RANK() function assigns a distinct rank to each row within a partition based on the provided column value with no gaps. 
This function will assign the same rank to two rows if they have the same rank, and give the next row the next rank number. 
To make this more concrete, imagine you had three records at rank 5 â€“ then, the next rank would be 6.
