INTERSECT combines the results from two or more SELECT statements, but only returns the rows that are exactly the same between 
the two sets.

For example, say you were doing an HR Analytics project for Snap, and had access to Snap's contractors and employees data. 
Assume that some employees were previously contractors, and vice versa, and thus would show up in both tables. 
You could use INTERSECT operator to find all employees who also show up in the contractors table:


SELECT first_name, last_name
FROM snap_employees

INTERSECT

SELECT first_name, last_name
FROM snap_contractors
