A FOREIGN KEY is a field in a table that references the PRIMARY KEY of another table. It creates a link between the two tables and ensures that the data in the FOREIGN KEY field is valid.

Say for example you had sales analytics data from Apple's CRM (customer-relationship management) tool.

CREATE TABLE apple_accounts (
    account_id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
    account_name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    industry VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL
);

CREATE TABLE opportunities (
    opportunity_id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
    opportunity_name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    account_id INTEGER NOT NULL,
    FOREIGN KEY (account_id) REFERENCES apple_accounts(account_id)
);
