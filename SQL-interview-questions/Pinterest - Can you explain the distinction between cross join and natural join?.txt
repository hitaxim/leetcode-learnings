Cross join and natural join are like two sides of a coin in the world of SQL.

Cross joins is like the wild and reckless cousin who creates a giant new table by combining every row from table A 
with every row from table B, no questions asked, no common key needed.

Natural joins are like the more refined and selective cousin who only combines rows from multiple tables if they have 
something in common (i.e., common columns/keys).

While cross join doesn't discriminate and will create a massive table if given the chance, natural join is more selective 
and only returns a table with the number of rows equal to the number of matching rows in the input tables. 

So, choose your JOIN wisely!
