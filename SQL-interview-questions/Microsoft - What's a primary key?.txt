A primary key is a column or set of columns in a table that uniquely identifies each row in the table. 
The primary key is used to enforce the uniqueness and non-nullability of the rows in the table.

In a SQL database, a primary key is defined using the PRIMARY KEY constraint. For example, say you had a table of microsoft_employees:

CREATE TABLE microsoft_employees (
    EmployeeID INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
    LastName VARCHAR(255),
    FirstName VARCHAR(255),
    Age INTEGER,
    Salary DECIMAL(8,2)
);

In this example, the EmployeeID column is the primary key of the Microsoft employees table. 
It is defined as an integer and is marked as the primary key using the PRIMARY KEY constraint.


A table can have only one primary key, but the primary key can consist of multiple columns. 
For example, say you had a table of Microsoft customer transactions:

CREATE TABLE transactions (
    TransactionID INTEGER,
    ProductID INTEGER,
    Quantity INTEGER,
    PRIMARY KEY (TransactionID, ProductID)
);
